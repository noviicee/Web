# Problem Description

Create a page that will display an image changing effect on mouse over in a file named imgeffect.html.

Initially the page would get displayed as below with only an image of apple (apple.jpg : with no-repeat attribute set to it in the same line )

![apple](./apple.jpg)

When we mouse over this image a transition effect on the image needs to happen, changing the image from apple to mango (mango.jpg : with no-repeat attribute set to it in the same line )

The page then should display :

![mango](./mango.jpg)

Create a webpage using the fields below:

A `<div>` tag, with "step1" as class.

The width and height are 250px and 300px respectively.
Initially it must be appear with the image "apple" with 100px margin.
For the transisition, change the CSS3 properites of the div tag named as "step1" to

Width as 350px, height as 300px and change the image from apple to mango with the same margin value.
